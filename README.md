## Hi there, my name is Saqib Fayaz.üëã


Where I have Been:

	1.	Education Background:
	‚Ä¢	Completed a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science in 2018 from SRM University.
	‚Ä¢	Struggled with mathematics during college but persisted by relearning it from scratch and eventually passed all courses.
	2.	Work Experience:
	‚Ä¢	Worked as a web developer in Bangalore but didn‚Äôt feel a deep connection to it.
	‚Ä¢	Returned to Kashmir due to family issues and started preparing for the  UPSC Civil Services exam, with psychology as your optional subject.
	3.	UPSC Preparation:
	‚Ä¢	Studied subjects like economics, history, and government publications.
	‚Ä¢	Realized that India‚Äôs development challenges stem from inefficient resource management.
	‚Ä¢	Gained an interest in data and the potential of data analytics to address resource management issues.
	4.	Shift to Data Analytics:
	‚Ä¢	Decided to pursue data analytics after failing the UPSC exam.
	‚Ä¢	Completed the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera as a starting point.
	‚Ä¢	Studied YouTube tutorials and read ‚ÄúPython for Data Analysis‚Äù by Wes McKinney.
	‚Ä¢	Worked on several guided projects in data analytics, focusing on data preprocessing, wrangling, and plotting.
	5.	Interest in Mathematics and Analytics:
	‚Ä¢	Developed a fascination for the mathematics behind analytics, learning about practical applications of statistical tools like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

Where I Want to Go:

	1.	Curiosity and Learning Goals:
	‚Ä¢	Eager to gain in-depth knowledge of analytics and its mathematical foundations.
	‚Ä¢	Want to understand when to use basic concepts (mean, median, mode) versus more advanced techniques like KNN and regression.
	‚Ä¢	Passionate about going deep into subjects and curious to learn advanced analytics techniques.
	2.	Seeking Mentorship:
	‚Ä¢	Looking for a mentor to guide you in learning the foundations and practical applications of mathematical concepts in data analytics from the ground up.
